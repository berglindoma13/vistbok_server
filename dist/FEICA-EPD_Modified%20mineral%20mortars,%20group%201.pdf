<br />Delivery status
<br />Modified mineral mortars are generally manufactured
<br />and supplied as factory-made dry mortars. Factorymade dry mortar is a finished mixture of base materials
<br />which merely requires the addition of water and/or a
<br />polymer dispersion on the building site. The products
<br />can be supplied in 1-5 kg bags, 15-25 kg sacks, big
<br />bags (1 t), minitainers (1.2 t) or as silo goods (5-15 t).
<br />Paper sacks with polyethylene lining were modelled as
<br />packaging (worst-case approach).
<br />2.5
<br />Base materials/Ancillary materials
<br />Typically, the products covered by this EPD contain
<br />the following range of base materials and auxiliaries
<br />(% by mass):
<br />Inorganic binder: ~ 2 - 98
<br />Filler materials: ~ 0 - 90
<br />Additives: ~ 0 - 10
<br />Aqueous dispersion and/or dispersion powder: ~ 0 35
<br />These ranges are average values and the composition
<br />of products complying with the EPD can deviate from
<br />these concentration levels in individual cases. More
<br />detailed information is available in the respective
<br />manufacturer's documentation (e.g. product data
<br />sheets).
<br />Note: For companies to declare their products within
<br />the scope of this EPD it is not sufficient to simply
<br />comply with the product composition shown above.
<br />The application of this EPD is only possible for
<br />member companies of DBC, EFCC, FEICA, and IVK
<br />member associations and only for specific formulations
<br />with a total score below the declared maximum score
<br />for a product group according to the associated
<br />guidance document.

<br />2.6
<br />Manufacture
<br />The raw materials are stored in silos, big bags or sacks
<br />in the manufacturing plant and fed gravimetrically in</p>

<p>Environmental Product Declaration DBC, EFCC, FEICA, IVK – Modified mineral mortar, group 1</p>

<p>accordance with the respective formula and mixed
<br />intensively. The mix is then packaged.
<br />2.7</p>

<p>Environment and health during
<br />manufacturing
<br />The state of the art involves maximum recirculation of
<br />dry waste into production. Wherever dust is incurred
<br />during production in the plant, it is directed to a filter
<br />system considering the limit values applicable for the
<br />workplace and using the corresponding extraction
<br />plants. Sack discharge stations connected to the
<br />extraction plant offer employees additional protection
<br />from dust. Most of the dust collected in the filter system
<br />and any residue incurred during production is returned
<br />to the manufacturing process.
<br />Powder residues: Residual product is returned to the
<br />production process wherever possible.
<br />Air: Process air is dedusted autonomously, whereby
<br />the values are far below legal requirements.
<br />Water: The production process does not involve water.
<br />Very low volumes of water are required for laboratory
<br />tests and for sanitary facilities.
<br />Noise: Noise level measurements have indicated that
<br />all values established within the production facility fall
<br />below the hearing protection limit of 85dB(A).
<br />Waste: The main types of waste are powder waste,
<br />paper (paper bags) and foil. Low volumes of metal
<br />scrap (metal containers), waste oil (maintenance),
<br />wood (pallets) and commercial waste are incurred. All
<br />waste is separated, stored and redirected to the
<br />recycling circuit or disposed of.
<br />2.8
<br />Product processing/Installation
<br />Modified mineral mortars can be processed both
<br />automatically and manually. The mortars are either
<br />automatically removed from a silo using a dry conveyor
<br />or manually taken from the container, mixed with water
<br />and installed. The professional liability association's
<br />rules apply as well as the respective safety data sheets
<br />pertaining to the construction products. On account of
<br />the various hydrate levels of cement, lime and calcium
<br />sulphate binding agents in the mineral mortar, the
<br />fresh mortar mixed with water is usually strongly
<br />alkaline. In the case of more extensive contact, this
<br />alkaline state can cause serious damage to eyes and
<br />skin. Therefore, any contact with eyes or skin must be
<br />avoided by taking personal protective measures, and
<br />the information outlined on the safety data sheet must
<br />be observed. Uncontrolled dust emissions should be
<br />avoided. Modified mineral mortars may not be
<br />discharged into the sewage system, surface water or
<br />groundwater. Waste incurred on the building site
<br />(packaging, pallets, residual mortar) must be collected
<br />separately. Suitable waste disposal companies
<br />dispose of packaging materials and mortar sacks and
<br />return them to the recycling circuit. Dry mortar residue
<br />is taken back by the manufacturing plants and used as
<br />a raw material. No dry mortar residue in mortar sacks
<br />is incurred. Hard mortar residue can be recycled or
<br />disposed of as building site rubble.
<br />2.9
<br />Packaging
<br />A detailed description of packaging is provided in
<br />section 2.4. Empty, trickle-free paper containers and
<br />clean PE foils can be recycled.
<br />2.10 Condition of use
<br />A modified mineral mortar does not rot and is resistant
<br />to ageing when used in accordance with the
<br />5</p>

<p>designated purpose of the respective products. It is a
<br />durable product which, when used as adhesive,
<br />screed, waterproofing material or repair product,
<br />makes an essential contribution towards improving
<br />building function and value.
<br />2.11 Environment and health during use
<br />Owing to the stable crystalline bond and firm structure
<br />achieved after curing, emissions are extremely low and
<br />harmless to health when the respective products are
<br />used in accordance with the designated purpose. No
<br />risks are known for water, air and soil if the products
<br />are used as designated. Natural ionising radiation from
<br />mineral mortar is extremely low and negligible in terms
<br />of health hazards. Options for applications in indoor
<br />areas with permanent stays by people: Evidence of the
<br />emission performance of construction products in
<br />contact with indoor air and depending on the
<br />designated use must be submitted for applications in
<br />indoor areas with permanent stays by people, e.g. in
<br />accordance with the German AgBB test scheme or the
<br />GEV (Gemeinschaft Emissionskontrollierte
<br />Verlegewerkstoffe, Klebstoffe und Bauprodukte e.V.,
<br />Düsseldorf) EMICODE® marking system typically
<br />applied in Germany.
<br />2.12 Reference service life
<br />Modified mineral mortars decisively improve the
<br />usability of building structures and significantly extend
<br />their original service lives. The anticipated reference
<br />service life depends on the specific installation
<br />situation and the exposure associated with the product.
<br />It can be influenced by weathering as well as
<br />mechanical or chemical loads.
<br />2.13</p>

<p>Extraordinary effects</p>

<p>Fire
<br />In accordance with Commission Decision 94/611EC,
<br />modified mineral binding agents comprising finely
<br />distributed organic components must always be
<br />classified in reaction-to-fire class A1 ‘No contribution to
<br />fire’ in accordance with EN 13501­1.
<br />Where higher percentages of organic components are
<br />involved, it can also be assumed that at least the
<br />requirements of EN 13501­1 are maintained for fire
<br />class E and Efl.

<p>-</p>

<p>Water
<br />No relevant volumes of water-soluble substances
<br />hazardous to water are washed out when hardened
<br />modified mineral mortars are exposed to water (e.g.
<br />flooding). Modified mineral mortar is stable in terms of
<br />structure and is not subject to any changes in form
<br />when exposed to water and drying. If non-hardened
<br />modified mineral mortars are exposed to water an
<br />increase of the pH will take place.
<br />Mechanical destruction
<br />The mechanical destruction of modified mineral
<br />mortars does not lead to any decomposition products
<br />which are harmful to the environment or health. Dust</p>

<p>Environmental Product Declaration DBC, EFCC, FEICA, IVK – Modified mineral mortar, group 1</p>

<p>incurred during de-construction should be avoided by
<br />taking the appropriate measures (e.g. humidification).
<br />2.14 Re-use phase
<br />Components manufactured using modified mineral
<br />mortars can usually be easily demolished. When a
<br />building is removed, the materials do not need to be
<br />treated as special waste; care should, however, be
<br />taken to ensure unmixed residual materials wherever
<br />possible. Modified mineral mortars can usually be
<br />redirected to normal building material recycling circuits.
<br />Re-use is generally in the form of recycled aggregate
<br />in building construction and civil engineering. No
<br />practical experience is currently available for reusing
<br />components comprising cementitious-based products
<br />after decommissioning.</p>

<p>amounts do not play a role when the construction
<br />product is disposed of. They do not interfere with the
<br />disposal/recycling of other components/building
<br />materials.
<br />The following waste codes according to the European
<br />List of Waste (2000/532/EC) can apply:
<br />Mineral mortar: EWC 17 01 01 and EWC 10 13 14
<br />Mineral filler and levelling compound: EWC 17 01 07
<br />Calcium sulphate-based filler and levelling compound:
<br />EWC 17 08 02

<br />product or safety data sheets and is available on the
<br />manufacturer's websites or on request. Valuable
<br />technical information is also available on the
<br />associations' websites.</p>

<br />System boundary
<br />Modules A1, A2 and A3 are taken into consideration in
<br />the LCA:
<br />- A1 Production of preliminary products
<br />- A2 Transport to the plant
<br />- A3 Production incl. provision of energy, production of
<br />packaging as well as auxiliaries and consumables and
<br />waste treatment
<br />- A4 Transport to site
<br />- A5 Installation, product applied into the building
<br />during A5 phase operations and packaging disposal.
<br />The end of life for the packaging material considered is
<br />described below:
<br />-Incineration, for materials like plastic, wood and
<br />paper.
<br />-C1-C2-C4-D
<br />The building deconstruction (demolition process) takes
<br />place in the C1 module which considers energy
<br />generation and consumption of diesel and all the
<br />emissions connected with the fuel-burning process to
<br />6</p>

<p>run the machines. After the demolition, the product is
<br />transported to the end-of-life processing (C2 module)
<br />where all the impacts related to the transport
<br />processes are considered. For precautionary principle
<br />and as a worst-case scenario, landfilling is the only
<br />end-of-life scenario considered. This is modelled by
<br />the landfill process (module C4) where the product
<br />ends its life cycle.
<br />Module D accounts for potential benefits that are
<br />beyond the defined system boundaries. Credits are
<br />generated during the incineration of packaging that is
<br />occurring in the A5 module.
<br />3.3
<br />Estimates and assumptions
<br />For this EPD formulation and production data defined
<br />and collected by FEICA were considered. Production
<br />waste was assumed to be disposed of by landfilling as
<br />a worst case.
<br />An average of paper sacks with polyethylene lining and
<br />wooden pallets was considered in the LCA.
<br />3.4
<br />Cut-off criteria
<br />All raw materials submitted for the formulations and
<br />production data were taken into consideration.
<br />The manufacture of machinery, plant and other
<br />infrastructure required for the production of the
<br />products under review was not taken into consideration
<br />in the LCA.
<br />Transport of packaging materials is excluded.
<br />3.5
<br />Background data
<br />Data from the GaBi 10 database SP40 (2020) was
<br />used as background data.
<br />3.6
<br />Data quality
<br />Representative products were applied for this EPD and
<br />the product in the group displaying the highest
<br />environmental impact was selected for calculating the
<br />LCA results. The background datasets used are less
<br />than 4 years old.
<br />Production data and packaging are based on details
<br />provided by the manufacturer. The formulation used for
<br />evaluation refers to a specific product.
<br />The data quality of the background data is considered
<br />to be good.</p>

<br />3.8
<br />Allocation
<br />Mass allocation has been applied when primary data
<br />have been used and implemented into the LCA model.</p>

<p>3.9
<br />Comparability
<br />Basically, a comparison or an evaluation of EPD data
<br />is only possible if all the data sets to be compared
<br />were created according to EN 15804 and the building
<br />context, respectively the product-specific
<br />characteristics of performance, are taken into account.
<br />The GaBi 10 database SP40 (2020) was used.</p>

<br />Additional environmental impact indicators (suggested by EN15804, table 4) are not declared in the EPD. The
<br />results of this environmental impact indicator shall be used with care as the uncertainties on these results are high
<br />and as there is limited experience with the indicator (see ILCD classification in EN 15804, table 5). For this
<br />reason, results based on these indicators are not considered suitable for a decision-making process and are thus
<br />not declared in the EPD.</p>

<p>6. LCA: Interpretation
<br />The majority of impacts are associated with the
<br />production phase (A1-A3). The most significant
<br />contribution to the production phase impacts is the
<br />upstream production of raw materials as the main
<br />driver. Besides the cement also the dispersion powder
<br />influences the results significantly, although this is only
<br />used for up to 8 % of the total composition. Significant
<br />contributions to Primary Energy Demand – Nonrenewable (PENRT) derive from the energy resources
<br />used in the production of raw materials. The largest
<br />contributor to Primary Energy Demand – Renewable
<br />(PERT) is the consumption of renewable energy
<br />resources required for the generation and supply of
<br />electricity. During manufacturing (A1-A3) some
<br />influence also arises due to the wooden pallets and
<br />paper used as packaging that need solar energy for
<br />photosynthesis. It should be noted that Primary Energy
<br />Demand – Renewable (PERT) generally represents a
<br />small percentage of the production phase primary
<br />energy demand with the bulk of the demand coming
<br />from non-renewable energy resources.</p>

<p>In all EPDs, CO2 is the most important contributor to
<br />Global Warming Potential (GWP). For the Acidification
<br />Potential (AP), NOx and SO2 contribute the largest
<br />share.
<br />Transportation to the construction site (A4) and the
<br />installation process (A5) make a minor contribution to
<br />almost all impacts. The only exception is a relevant
<br />influence of carbon dioxide emissions in module A5 to
<br />Global Warming Potential (GWP) due to the
<br />incineration of the packaging materials plastic, paper
<br />and pallets.
<br />In module A4, transport to construction site, values for
<br />Eutrophication (freshwater, marine and terrestrial)
<br />have an impact due principally to the emission of
<br />phosphate. Furthermore, climate change from land use
<br />change is influenced by transport processes, due to
<br />the diesel production used as fuel, because part of this
<br />diesel has been produced from bio-based raw
<br />materials.
<br />The end-of-life phases have a negligible influence on
<br />all impacts.</p>

<br />Model EPD. Some member states require special
<br />documentation on leaching for specific areas of
<br />application. This documentation has to be provided
<br />separately and is specific to the product in question.</p>

<p>If of relevance for the application (usually if the
<br />products are used outside of buildings) the leaching
<br />behaviour has to be measured e.g. according to DIN
<br />EN 12457/1­­4 or DIN EN 14405 combined with the
<br />Council decision 2003/33/EC.</p>
