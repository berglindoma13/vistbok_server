<br />2.5
<br />Delivery status
<br />Modified mineral mortars are generally manufactured
<br />and supplied as factory-made dry mortars. Factorymade dry mortar is a finished mixture of base materials
<br />which merely requires the addition of water on the
<br />building site. The products can be supplied in 1-5 kg
<br />bags, 15-25 kg sacks, Big Bags (1 t), minitainers (1.2 t)
<br />or as silo goods (5-15 t).
<br />Paper sacks with polyethylene lining were modelled as
<br />packaging (worst-case approach).
<br />2.6
<br />Base materials / Ancillary materials
<br />On average, the products covered by this EPD contain
<br />the following ranges of base materials and auxiliaries
<br />referred to:
<br />Cement: ~ 2 - 85%
<br />Filler materials: ~ 10 - 90%
<br />Plaster: ~ 0 - 45%
<br />Additives: ~ 0 - 6%
<br />Dispersion powder: ~ 0 - 5%
<br />These ranges are average values and the composition
<br />of products complying with the EPD can deviate from
<br />these concentration levels in individual cases. More
<br />detailed information is available in the respective
<br />manufacturer's documentation (e.g. product data
<br />sheets).
<br />In individual cases, it is possible that substances on
<br />the list of materials of particularly high concern for
<br />inclusion in Annex XIV of the /REACH/ regulation are
<br />contained in concentrations exceeding 0.1%. If this is
<br />the case, this information can be found on the
<br />respective safety data sheet. Mortar for special</p>

<p>Environmental Product Declaration FEICA – Modified mineral mortars, group 1</p>

<p>applications can also contain fungicides, whereby the
<br />functional group of fungicides is dependent on the
<br />chemical specification.
<br />2.7
<br />Manufacture
<br />The raw materials are stored in silos, big bags or sacks
<br />in the manufacturing plant and fed gravimetrically in
<br />accordance with the respective formula and mixed
<br />intensively. The mix is then packaged.
<br />Quality and environmental standards in accordance
<br />with /ISO 9001:2008-12/ and the provisions outlined in
<br />the relevant regulations such as the Industrial Safety
<br />Regulation and Federal Pollution Control Act are
<br />adhered to.
<br />2.8</p>

<p>Environment and health during
<br />manufacturing
<br />The state-of-the-art involves maximum recirculation of
<br />dry waste into production. Wherever dust is incurred
<br />during production in the plant, it is directed to a filter
<br />system taking consideration of the limit values
<br />applicable for the workplace and using the
<br />corresponding extraction plants. Sack discharge
<br />stations connected to the extraction plant offer
<br />employees additional protection from dust. Most of the
<br />dust collected in the filter system and any residue
<br />incurred during production is returned to the
<br />manufacturing process.
<br />Powder residues: Residual product is returned to the
<br />production process wherever possible.
<br />Air: Process air is dedusted autonomously, whereby
<br />the values are far below legal requirements.
<br />Water: The production process does not involve water.
<br />Very low volumes of water are required for laboratory
<br />tests and for sanitary facilities.
<br />Noise: Noise level measurements have indicated that
<br />all values established within the production facility fall
<br />below the hearing protection limit of 85dB(A).
<br />Waste: The main types of waste are powder waste,
<br />paper (paper bags) and foil. Low volumes of metal
<br />scrap (metal containers), waste oil (maintenance),
<br />wood (pallets) and commercial waste are incurred. All
<br />waste is separated, stored and redirected to the
<br />recycling circuit or disposed of.
<br />2.9
<br />Product processing/Installation
<br />Modified mineral mortars can be processed both
<br />automatically and manually. The mortars are either
<br />automatically removed from a silo using a dry conveyor
<br />or manually taken from the container, mixed with water
<br />and installed.
<br />The professional liability association's rules apply as
<br />well as the respective safety data sheets pertaining to
<br />the construction products.
<br />On account of the various hydrate levels of cement,
<br />lime and calcium sulphate binding agents in the
<br />mineral mortar, the fresh mortar mixed with water is
<br />usually strongly alkaline. In the case of more extensive
<br />contact, this alkaline state can cause serious damage
<br />to eyes and skin. Therefore, any contact with eyes or
<br />skin must be avoided by taking personal protective
<br />measures and the information outlined on the safety
<br />data sheet must be observed.
<br />Uncontrolled dust emissions should be avoided.
<br />Modified mineral mortars may not be discharged into
<br />the sewage system, surface water or groundwater.
<br />Waste incurred on the building site (packaging, pallets,
<br />residual mortar) must be collected separately. Suitable
<br />waste disposal companies dispose of packaging
<br />materials and mortar sacks and return them to the
<br />recycling circuit. Dry mortar residue is taken back by
<br />4</p>

<p>the manufacturing plants and used as a raw
<br />material.No dry mortar residue in mortar sacks is
<br />incurred. Hard mortar residue can be recycled or
<br />disposed of as building site rubble.
<br />2.10 Packaging
<br />A detailed description of packaging is provided in
<br />section 2.5. Empty, trickle-free paper containers and
<br />clean PE foils can be recycled.
<br />2.11 Condition of use
<br />Modified mineral mortar does not rot and is resistant to
<br />ageing when used in accordance with the designated
<br />purpose of the respective products.
<br />It is a durable product which, when used as adhesive,
<br />screed, waterproofing material or repair product,
<br />makes an essential contribution towards improving
<br />building function and value.
<br />2.12 Environment and health during use
<br />Owing to the stable crystalline bond and firm structure
<br />achieved after curing, emissions are extremely low and
<br />harmless to health when used in accordance with the
<br />designated purpose of the respective products.
<br />No risks are known for water, air and soil if the
<br />products are used as designated.
<br />Natural ionising radiation from mineral mortar is
<br />extremely low and negligible in terms of health
<br />hazards.
<br />Options for applications in indoor areas with
<br />permanent stays by people:
<br />Evidence of the emission performance of construction
<br />products in contact with indoor air and depending on
<br />the designated use must be submitted for applications
<br />in indoor areas with permanent stays by people, e.g. in
<br />accordance with the /AgBB/ test scheme or the /GEV/
<br />(Gemeinschaft Emissionskontrollierte
<br />Verlegewerkstoffe, Klebstoffe und Bauprodukte e.V.,
<br />Düsseldorf) /EMICODE/® marking system typically
<br />applied in Germany.
<br />2.13 Reference service life
<br />Modified mineral mortars decisively improve the
<br />usability of building structures and significantly extend
<br />their original service lives.
<br />The anticipated reference service life depends on the
<br />specific installation situation and the exposure
<br />associated with the product. It can be influenced by
<br />weathering as well as mechanical or chemical loads.
<br />2.14</p>

<p>Extraordinary effects</p>

<p>Fire
<br />In accordance with Commission Decision 94/611EC,
<br />modified mineral binding agents comprising finelydistributed organic components must always be
<br />classified in reaction-to-fire class A1 "No contribution
<br />to fire" in accordance with /EN 13501-1/.
<br />Where higher percentages of organic components are
<br />involved, it can also be assumed that at least the
<br />requirements of /EN 13501-1/ are maintained for fire
<br />class E and Efl.
<br />Water
<br />No relevant volumes of water-soluble substances
<br />hazardous to water are washed out when exposed to
<br />water (e.g. flooding). Cement-based mortar is stable in
<br />terms of structure and is not subject to any changes in
<br />form when exposed to water and drying.</p>

<p>Environmental Product Declaration FEICA – Modified mineral mortars, group 1</p>

<p>Mechanical destruction
<br />The mechanical destruction of modified mineral
<br />mortars does not lead to any decomposition products
<br />which are harmful for the environment or health. Dust
<br />incurred during de-construction should be avoided by
<br />taking the appropriate measures (e.g. humidification).
<br />2.15 Re-use phase
<br />Components manufactured using modified mineral
<br />mortars can usually be easily demolished. When
<br />removing a building, the materials do not need to be
<br />treated as special waste; care should, however, be
<br />taken to ensure unmixed residual materials wherever
<br />possible. Mineral mortars can usually be redirected to
<br />normal building material recycling circuits. Re-use is
<br />generally in the form of recycled aggregate in building
<br />construction and civil engineering.
<br />No practical experience is currently available for reusing components comprising modified mineral mortar
<br />after decommissioning.</p>

<p>2.16 Disposal
<br />The portion of a modified mineral mortar-based
<br />product applied at an other construction product is
<br />rather low. These low amounts do not play a role
<br />when the construction product is disposed. They do
<br />not interfere with the disposal/recycling of other
<br />components / building materials.
<br />The following European Waste Codes waste (EWC)
<br />codes can apply:
<br />Mineral mortar: /EWC 2000/532/EC 170101/ and
<br />/EWC 2000/532/EC 101314/
<br />Mineral filler and levelling compound: /EWC
<br />2000/532/EC 170107/
<br />Calcium sulphate-based filler and levelling compound:
<br />/EWC 2000/532/EC 170802/
<br />2.17 Further information
<br />More information is available in the manufacturer's
<br />product or safety data sheets and is available on the
<br />manufacturer's Web sites or on request. Valuable
<br />technical information is also available on the
<br />associations' Web sites.</p>

<p>3. LCA: Calculation rules
<br />3.1
<br />Declared Unit
<br />This EPD refers to the declared unit of 1 kg modified
<br />mineral mortar with a density of 800 - 1,700 kg/m³.
<br />The results of the Life Cycle Assessment provided in
<br />this declaration have been calculated from the product
<br />with the highest environmental impact (worst-case
<br />scenario).
<br />With the information about the consumption per
<br />surface area the results can be calculated into a
<br />declared unit of kg/m³.

<p>3.2
<br />System boundary
<br />Modules A1-A3, A4, A5 and D are taken into
<br />consideration in the LCA:
<br />
<br />A1 Production of preliminary products
<br />
<br />A2 Transport to plant
<br />
<br />A3 Production incl. provision of energy,
<br />production of packaging as well as auxiliaries
<br />and consumables, waste treatment)
<br />
<br />A4 Transport to site
<br />
<br />A5 Installation (disposal of packaging &amp;
<br />installation losses and emissions during
<br />installation)
<br />
<br />D Credits from incineration of packaging
<br />materials
<br />The declaration is therefore from "cradle to gate - with
<br />options".
<br />3.3
<br />Estimates and assumptions
<br />Where no specific /GaBi/ processes were available,
<br />the individual recipe ingredients of formulation were
<br />estimated on the basis of information provided by the
<br />manufacturer or literary sources.</p>

<p>5</p>

<p>3.4
<br />Cut-off criteria
<br />All raw materials submitted for the formulations and
<br />production data were taken into consideration. The
<br />manufacture of machinery, plants and other
<br />infrastructure required for production of the products
<br />under review was not taken into consideration in the
<br />LCA. Transport of packaging materials is also
<br />excluded.
<br />3.5
<br />Background data
<br />Data from the /GaBi/ ts database was used as
<br />background data. Where no background data was
<br />available, it was complemented by manufacturer
<br />information and literary research.
<br />3.6
<br />Data quality
<br />Representative products were applied for this EPD and
<br />the product in a group displaying the highest
<br />environmental impact was selected for calculating the
<br />LCA results. The datasets are less than 5 years old.
<br />Production data and packaging are based on details
<br />provided by the manufacturer. The formulation used for
<br />evaluation refers to a specific product.
<br />3.7
<br />Period under review
<br />Representative formulations were accepted by FEICA
<br />Ltd and collected in 2011.
<br />3.8
<br />Allocation
<br />No allocations were applied for production. A multiinput
<br />allocation with a credit for electricity and thermal
<br />energy was used for incineration of packaging
<br />materials. The credits achieved through packaging
<br />disposal are declared in Module D.
<br />3.9
<br />Comparability
<br />Basically, a comparison or an evaluation of EPD data
<br />is only possible if all the data sets to be compared
<br />were created according to /EN 15804/ and the building
<br />context, respectively the product-specific
<br />characteristics of performance, are taken into account.
<br />In this case, 1 kg modified mineral mortar was selected
<br />as the declared unit. Depending on the application, a
<br />corresponding conversion factor such as the specific
<br />use per surface area must be taken into consideration.</p>

<p>Not all of the used inventories for the calculation of the LCA support the methodological approach for the
<br />declaration of water and waste indicators. The material amounts, displayed with these inventories, contribute
<br />significantly to the production. The indicators Use of fresh water, Hazardous waste disposed, Non-hazardous
<br />waste disposed and Radioactive waste disposed are therefore not declared (decision of IBU advisory board 201301-07).</p>

<p>6. LCA: Interpretation
<br />All impacts are associated with the production phase
<br />(A1-A3). The most significant contribution to the
<br />production phase impacts is the upstream production
<br />of raw materials as main driver. The majority of life
<br />cycle energy consumption takes place during the
<br />production phase (A1-A3). Besides the cement also
<br />the dispersion powder influences the results
<br />significantly, although this is only used up to 5%.
<br />Significant contributions to Primary Energy Demand –
<br />Non-renewable (PENRT) derive from the energy
<br />resources used in the production of raw materials. The
<br />largest contributor to Primary Energy Demand –
<br />Renewable (PERT) is the consumption of renewable
<br />7</p>

<p>energy resources required for the generation and
<br />supply of electricity. During manufacturing (A1-A3)
<br />some influence also arises due to the wooden pallets
<br />and paper used as packaging that need solar energy
<br />for photosynthesis. It should be noted that Primary
<br />Energy Demand – Renewable (PERT) generally
<br />represents a small percentage of the production phase
<br />primary energy demand with the bulk of the demand
<br />coming from non-renewable energy resources.
<br />CO2 is the most important contributor to Global
<br />Warming Potential (GWP). For the Acidification
<br />Potential (AP), NOx and SO2 contribute to the largest
<br />share.</p>

<p>Environmental Product Declaration FEICA – Modified mineral mortars, group 1</p>

<p>Transportation to the construction site (A4) and the
<br />installation process (A5) make a negligible contribution
<br />to almost all impacts. The only exception is a relevant
<br />influence of carbon dioxide emissions in module A5 to
<br />Global Warming Potential (GWP) due to the
<br />incineration of the packaging materials paper and
<br />pallets.
<br />In module A4, transport to construction site, values for
<br />Photochemical Ozone Creation Potential (POCP) are
<br />negative due to emission profile modelled for the
<br />selected transportation process and of the
<br />characterisation method used in CML 2001 for the
<br />calculation of the POCP. Transportation processes are
<br />responsible for the emission of NOx in the ground layer
<br />atmosphere. NO in particular can have an ozone</p>

<p>depleting effect that is reflected in CML 2001 by
<br />assigning a negative characterisation factor to this
<br />substance. However, although these negative values
<br />may appear unusual, it should be considered that
<br />POCP is only one of the analysed environmental
<br />impact categories. All other potential impacts would
<br />increase with greater transportation distances, showing
<br />that transportation is a process leading to net
<br />environmental burdens. Furthermore, even for POCP,
<br />transportation processes needed for supply of
<br />materials and product distribution only have limited
<br />counterbalance effects on the overall LCA results.
<br />Energy credit from incineration of packaging material
<br />reported in module D show a negligible influence on
<br />the overall results.</p>

<p>7. Requisite evidence
<br />VOC
<br />Special tests and evidence have not been carried out
<br />or provided within the framework of drawing up this
<br />Model EPD. Some member states require special
<br />documentation on VOC emissions into indoor air for
<br />specific areas of application. This documentation, as
<br />well as documentation for voluntary VOC labelling, has
<br />to be provided separately and is specific for products in
<br />question.
<br />Evidence pertaining to VOC emissions shall show
<br />either an attestation of compliance with,
<br />or documentation of test data that are required in,
<br />any of the existing regulations or in any of the existing
<br />voluntary labelling programs for low-emitting products,
<br />as far as these
<br />(1) include limits for the parameters TVOC, TSVOC,
<br />carcinogens, formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, LCI limits
<br />for individual substances (including but not limited to
<br />the European list of harmonized LCIs), and the R
<br />value;
<br />(2) base their test methods on /CEN/TS 16516/ (or
<br />/EN 16516/, after the on-going revision of /CEN/TS
<br />16516/);
<br />(3) perform testing and apply the limits after 28 days
<br />storage in a ventilated test chamber, under the</p>

<p>conditions specified in /CEN/TS 16516/; some
<br />regulations and programs also have limits after 3 days,
<br />on top of the 28 days limits;
<br />(4) express the test results as air concentrations in
<br />the European Reference Room, as specified in
<br />/CEN/TS 16516/.
<br />Examples of such regulations are the Belgian /Royal
<br />Decree C-2014/24239/, or the German /AgBB/.
<br />Examples of such voluntary labelling programs are
<br />/EMICODE/, /Blue Angel/ or /Indoor Air Comfort/.
<br />Relevant test results shall be produced either by an
<br />/ISO 17025/ accredited commercial test lab, or by a
<br />qualified internal test lab of the manufacturer.
<br />Examples for the applied limits after 28 days of storage
<br />in a ventilated test chamber are:
<br />TVOC: 1000 µg/m³
<br />TSVOC: 100 µg/m³
<br />Each carcinogen: 1 µg/m³
<br />Formaldehyde: 100 µg/m³
<br />LCI: different per substance involved
<br />R value: 1 (meaning that, in total, 100% of the
<br />combined LCI values must not be exceeded).
<br />Informative Annexes (2 tables):</p>

<p>Table 1 shows an overview of the most relevant regulations and specifications as of April 2015, as regards
<br />requirements after 3 days of storage in a ventilated test chamber.
<br />Table 2 provides an overview of the most relevant regulations and specifications as of April 2015, as regards
<br />requirements after 28 days of storage in a ventilated test chamber. Some details may be missing in the table due
<br />to lack of space. Values given represent maximum
<br />values/limits.</p>
